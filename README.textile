h1. current_object

Do you need to keep track of a current user, account, page, etc? The current_object gem does just that.

@current_object@ takes the same approach to keeping track of a user as "SentientUser":https://github.com/bokmann/sentient_user
by David Bock, but goes completely class agnostic. You can even keep track of multiple "current" objects at once.

h2. Usage

Just require the @current_object@ gem into your project and @include CurrentObject@.

<pre><code>
# foo.rb
require 'current_object'

class Foo
  include CurrentObject
end

# using my foo class

@foo = Foo.new

# time to make this my current foo instance
@foo.current!

# what is my current foo instance?
Foo.current
</code></pre>
